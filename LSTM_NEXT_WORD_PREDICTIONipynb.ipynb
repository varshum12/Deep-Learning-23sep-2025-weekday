              "'Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.[1] Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.[2]\\n\\nML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics.\\n\\nStatistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning.[4][5]\\n\\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning. Most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as empirical risk minimization under this framework.\\n\\nHistory\\nSee also: Timeline of machine learning\\nThe term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.[6][7] The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period.[8][9]\\n\\nThe earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes.[10] In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells.[11] Hebb\\'s model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data.[10] Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.[10]\\n\\nBy the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions.[12] A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson\\'s book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.[13] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.[14] In 1981, a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.[15]\\n\\nTom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"[16] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing\\'s proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".[17]\\n\\nModern day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithms types: Supervised Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms.[18]\\n\\nCurrent Supervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of classification and regression.\\nCurrent Unsupervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule.\\nCurrent Reinforcement Learning Algorithms focus on decisions that must be made with respect to some previous, unknown time and are broken down to either be studies of model based methods, and model free methods.\\nIn 2014 Ian Goodfellow and others introduced generative adversarial networks (GANs) with realistic data synthesis.[19] By 2016 AlphaGo obtained victory against top human players using reinforcement learning techniques.[20] Shortly after, transformer architectures obtained natural language processing, powering the now popular large language models advancing generative AI and multimodal applications.[21]\\n\\nRelationships to other fields\\nArtificial intelligence\\n\\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence.[22]\\nAs a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence (AI). In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"neural networks\"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of statistics.[23] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.[24]:\\u200a488\\u200a\\n\\nHowever, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.[24]:\\u200a488\\u200a By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favour.[25] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.[24]:\\u200a708–710,\\u200a755\\u200a Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"connectionism\", by researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield, David Rumelhart, and Geoffrey Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.[24]:\\u200a25\\u200a\\n\\nMachine learning (ML), reorganised and recognised as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, fuzzy logic, and probability theory.[25]\\n\\nData compression\\nThis section is an excerpt from Data compression § Machine learning.[edit]\\nThere is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\".[26][27][28]\\n\\nAn alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space ℵ, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM.[29]\\n\\nAccording to AIXI theory, a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize, the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file\\'s compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form.\\n\\nExamples of AI-powered audio/video compression software include NVIDIA Maxine, AIVC.[30] Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include OpenCV, TensorFlow, MATLAB\\'s Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression.[31]\\n\\nIn unsupervised machine learning, k-means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression.[32]\\n\\nData compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the centroid of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing, k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space.[33]\\n\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets, as demonstrated by DeepMind\\'s research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla 70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) for images and Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) for audio. It achieved compression of image and audio data to 43.4% and 16.4% of their original sizes, respectively. There is, however, some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the LLM training data set, making it possible that the Chinchilla 70B model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on.[34][35]\\nData mining\\nMachine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"unsupervised learning\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.\\n\\nMachine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation: Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples).[36]\\n\\nGeneralization\\nCharacterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms.\\n\\nStatistics\\nMachine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns.[37]\\n\\nConventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be.[38]\\n\\nLeo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,[39] wherein \"algorithmic model\" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest.\\n\\nSome statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.[40]\\n\\nStatistical physics\\nAnalytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyse the weight space of deep neural networks.[41] Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics.[42]\\n\\nTheory\\nMain articles: Computational learning theory and Statistical learning theory\\nA core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience.[3][43] Generalisation in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.\\n\\nThe computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalisation error.\\n\\nFor the best performance in the context of generalisation, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalisation will be poorer.[44]\\n\\nIn addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.\\n\\nApproaches\\n\\n\\nIn supervised learning, the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning, the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data.\\nMachine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system:\\n\\nSupervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.\\nUnsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).\\nReinforcement learning: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that\\'s analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximise.[3]\\nAlthough each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems.[45][46][47]\\n\\nSupervised learning\\nMain article: Supervised learning\\n\\nA support-vector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear boundary. Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white.\\nSupervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.[48] The data, known as training data, consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix. Through iterative optimisation of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.[49] An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.[16]\\n\\nTypes of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression.[50] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range. For example, in a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input is an incoming email, and the output is the folder in which to file the email. In contrast, regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person\\'s height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data.[51]\\n\\nSimilarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.\\n\\nUnsupervised learning\\n\\nUnsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labelled, classified or categorised. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction,[5] and density estimation.[52]\\n\\nCluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity.\\n\\nA special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself.[53][54]\\n\\nSemi-supervised learning\\nMain article: Semi-supervised learning\\nSemi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labelled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labelled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabelled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labelled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.\\n\\nIn weakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.[55]\\n\\nReinforcement learning\\nMain article: Reinforcement learning\\n\\nIn reinforcement learning, an agent takes actions in an environment: these produce a reward and/or a representation of the state, which is fed back to the agent.\\nReinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximise some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimisation, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms. In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques.[56] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.\\n\\nDimensionality reduction\\nDimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.[57] In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the \"number of features\". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction. One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D). The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds, and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularisation.\\n\\nOther types\\nOther approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example, topic modelling, meta-learning.[58]\\n\\nSelf-learning\\nSelf-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named crossbar adaptive array (CAA).[59][60] It gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward, by introducing emotion as an internal reward. Emotion is used as state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.[61] The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine:\\n\\nin situation s perform action a\\nreceive a consequence situation s\\'\\ncompute emotion of being in the consequence situation v(s\\')\\nupdate crossbar memory w\\'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s\\')\\nIt is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behaviour) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioural environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioural environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behaviour, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.[62]\\n\\nFeature learning\\nMain article: Feature learning\\nSeveral learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training.[63] Classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual feature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.\\n\\nFeature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labelled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabelled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorisation[64] and various forms of clustering.[65][66][67]\\n\\nManifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors.[68] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.[69]\\n\\nFeature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.\\n\\nSparse dictionary learning\\nMain article: Sparse dictionary learning\\nSparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix. The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately.[70] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k-SVD algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.[71]\\n\\nAnomaly detection\\nMain article: Anomaly detection\\nIn data mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.[72] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.[73]\\n\\nIn particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.[74]\\n\\nThree broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.[75] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabelled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.\\n\\nRobot learning\\nRobot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning,[76][77] and finally meta-learning (e.g. MAML).\\n\\nAssociation rules\\nMain article: Association rule learning\\nSee also: Inductive logic programming\\nAssociation rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\".[78]\\n\\nRule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilisation of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.[79] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.\\n\\nBased on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets.[80] For example, the rule \\n{\\no\\nn\\ni\\no\\nn\\ns\\n,\\np\\no\\nt\\na\\nt\\no\\ne\\ns\\n}\\n⇒\\n{\\nb\\nu\\nr\\ng\\ne\\nr\\n}\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\{\\\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\\\}\\\\Rightarrow \\\\{\\\\mathrm {burger} \\\\}} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements. In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.\\n\\nLearning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning. They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.[81]\\n\\nInductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs.\\n\\nInductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing. Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.[82][83][84] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.[85] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.\\n\\nModels\\nA machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that, once \"trained\" on a given dataset, can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data. During training, a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model\\'s internal parameters to minimise errors in its predictions.[86] By extension, the term \"model\" can refer to several levels of specificity, from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned.[87]\\n\\nVarious types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems, picking the best model for a task is called model selection.\\n\\nArtificial neural networks\\nMain article: Artificial neural network\\nSee also: Deep learning\\n\\nAn artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in a brain. Here, each circular node represents an artificial neuron and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another.\\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.\\n\\nAn ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \"artificial neurons\", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a \"signal\", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\\n\\nThe original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.\\n\\nDeep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[88]\\n\\nDecision trees\\nMain article: Decision tree learning\\n\\nA decision tree showing survival probability of passengers on the Titanic\\nDecision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item\\'s target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels, and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making.\\n\\nRandom forest regression\\nRandom forest regression (RFR) falls under umbrella of decision tree-based models. RFR is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and to avoid overfitting. To build decision trees, RFR uses bootstrapped sampling, for instance each decision tree is trained on random data from the training set. This random selection of RFR for training enables model to reduce bias predictions and achieve a higher degree of accuracy. RFR generates independent decision trees, and it can work on single output data as well multiple regressor tasks. This makes RFR compatible to be used in various applications.[89][90]\\n\\nSupport-vector machines\\nMain article: Support-vector machine\\nSupport-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category.[91] An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\\n\\nRegression analysis\\nMain article: Regression analysis\\n\\nIllustration of linear regression on a data set\\nRegression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. The latter is often extended by regularisation methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[92]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.\\n\\nMultivariate linear regression extends the concept of linear regression to handle multiple dependent variables simultaneously. This approach estimates the relationships between a set of input variables and several output variables by fitting a multidimensional linear model. It is particularly useful in scenarios where outputs are interdependent or share underlying patterns, such as predicting multiple economic indicators or reconstructing images,[93] which are inherently multi-dimensional.\\n\\nBayesian networks\\nMain article: Bayesian network\\n\\nA simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet.\\nA Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalisations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.\\n\\nGaussian processes\\nMain article: Gaussian processes\\n\\nAn example of Gaussian Process Regression (prediction) compared with other regression models[94]\\nA Gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution, and it relies on a pre-defined covariance function, or kernel, that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations.\\n\\nGiven a set of observed points, or input–output examples, the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new, unobserved point.\\n\\nGaussian processes are popular surrogate models in Bayesian optimisation used to do hyperparameter optimisation.\\n\\nGenetic algorithms\\nMain article: Genetic algorithm\\nA genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.[95][96] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[97]\\n\\nBelief functions\\nMain article: Dempster–Shafer theory\\nThe theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or Dempster–Shafer theory, is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility and imprecise probability theories. These theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined (e.g., Dempster\\'s rule of combination), just like how in a pmf-based Bayesian approach would combine probabilities.[98] However, there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification. These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learner\\'s decision boundary, low samples, and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving.[99][7] However, the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions (classes), and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches.'"

researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield  David Rumelhart  and Geoffrey Hinton  Their main success came in the mid 1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation  24   25   Machine learning  ML   reorganised and recognised as its own field  started to flourish in the 1990s  The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature  It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI  and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics  fuzzy logic  and probability theory  25   Data compression This section is an excerpt from Data compression   Machine learning  edit  There is a close connection between machine learning and compression  A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression  by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution   Conversely  an optimal compressor can be used for prediction  by finding the symbol that compresses best  given the previous history   This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for  general intelligence   26  27  28   An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors  and compression based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces  For each compressor C    we define an associated vector space    such that C    maps an input string x  corresponding to the vector norm    x    An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space  instead  feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods  LZW  LZ77  and PPM  29   According to AIXI theory  a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize  the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x  For example  in that model  a zip file s compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software  since you can not unzip it without both  but there may be an even smaller combined form   Examples of AI powered audio video compression software include NVIDIA Maxine  AIVC  30  Examples of software that can perform AI powered image compression include OpenCV  TensorFlow  MATLAB s Image Processing Toolbox  IPT  and High Fidelity Generative Image Compression  31   In unsupervised machine learning  k means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters  This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression  32   Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files  enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission  K means clustering  an unsupervised machine learning algorithm  is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters  k  each represented by the centroid of its points  This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points  Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing  k means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids  thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significa'"

              "'Machine learning  ML  is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data  and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions  1  Within a subdiscipline in machine learning  advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks  a class of statistical algorithms  to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance  2   ML finds application in many fields  including natural language processing  computer vision  speech recognition  email filtering  agriculture  and medicine  The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics   Statistics and mathematical optimisation  mathematical programming  methods comprise the foundations of machine learning  Data mining is a related field of study  focusing on exploratory data analysis  EDA  via unsupervised learning  4  5   From a theoretical viewpoint  probably approximately correct learning provides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning  Most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as empirical risk minimization under this framework   History See also  Timeline of machine learning The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel  an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence  6  7  The synonym self teaching computers was also used in this time period  8  9   The earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side  but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes  10  In 1949  Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior  in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells  11  Hebb s model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes  or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data  10  Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well  including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch  who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes  10   By the early 1960s  an experimental  learning machine  with punched tape memory  called Cybertron  had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals  electrocardiograms  and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning  It was repetitively  trained  by a human operator teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a  goof  button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions  12  A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson s book on Learning Machines  dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification  13  Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s  as described by Duda and Hart in 1973  14  In 1981  a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognise 40 characters  26 letters  10 digits  and 4 special symbols  from a computer terminal  15   Tom M  Mitchell provided a widely quoted  more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field   A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T  as measured by P  improves with experience E   16  This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms  This follows Alan Turing s proposal in his paper  Computing Machinery and Intelligence   in which the question  Can machines think   is replaced with the question  Can machines do what we  as thinking entities  can do    17   Modern day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithms types  Supervised Learning Algorithms  Unsupervised Learning Algorithms  and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms  18   Current Supervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of classification and regression  Current Unsupervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of clustering  dimensionality reduction  and association rule  Current Reinforcement Learning Algorithms focus on decisions that must be made with respect to some previous  unknown time and are broken down to either be studies of model based methods  and model free methods  In 2014 Ian Goodfellow and others introduced generative adversarial networks  GANs  with realistic data synthesis  19  By 2016 AlphaGo obtained victory against top human players using reinforcement learning techniques  20  Shortly after  transformer architectures obtained natural language processing  powering the now popular large language models advancing generative AI and multimodal applications  21   Relationships to other fields Artificial intelligence  Deep learning is a subset of machine learning  which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence  22  As a scientific endeavour  machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence  AI   In the early days of AI as an academic discipline  some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data  They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods  as well as what were then termed  neural networks   these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of statistics  23  Probabilistic reasoning was also employed  especially in automated medical diagnosis  24   488   However  an increasing emphasis on the logical  knowledge based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning  Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation  24   488  By 1980  expert systems had come to dominate AI  and statistics was out of favour  25  Work on symbolic knowledge based learning did continue within AI  leading to inductive logic programming ILP   but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper  in pattern recognition and information retrieval  24   708 710  755  Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time  This line  too  was continued outside the AI CS field  as  connectionism   by researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield  David Rumelhart  and Geoffrey Hinton  Their main success came in the mid 1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation  24   25   Machine learning  ML   reorganised and recognised as its own field  started to flourish in the 1990s  The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature  It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI  and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics  fuzzy logic  and probability theory  25   Data compression This section is an excerpt from Data compression   Machine learning  edit  There is a close connection between machine learning and compression  A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression  by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution   Conversely  an optimal compressor can be used for prediction  by finding the symbol that compresses best  given the previous history   This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for  general intelligence   26  27  28   An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors  and compression based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces  For each compressor C    we define an associated vector space    such that C    maps an input string x  corresponding to the vector norm    x    An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space  instead  feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods  LZW  LZ77  and PPM  29   According to AIXI theory  a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize  the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x  For example  in that model  a zip file s compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software  since you can not unzip it without both  but there may be an even smaller combined form   Examples of AI powered audio video compression software include NVIDIA Maxine  AIVC  30  Examples of software that can perform AI powered image compression include OpenCV  TensorFlow  MATLAB s Image Processing Toolbox  IPT  and High Fidelity Generative Image Compression  31   In unsupervised machine learning  k means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters  This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression  32   Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files  enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission  K means clustering  an unsupervised machine learning algorithm  is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters  k  each represented by the centroid of its points  This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points  Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing  k means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids  thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significa'"

              "'Machine learning  ML  is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data  and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions  1  Within a subdiscipline in machine learning  advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks  a class of statistical algorithms  to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance  2   ML finds application in many fields  including natural language processing  computer vision  speech recognition  email filtering  agriculture  and medicine  The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics   Statistics and mathematical optimisation  mathematical programming  methods comprise the foundations of machine learning  Data mining is a related field of study  focusing on exploratory data analysis  EDA  via unsupervised learning  4  5   From a theoretical viewpoint  probably approximately correct learning provides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning  Most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as empirical risk minimization under this framework   History See also  Timeline of machine learning The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel  an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence  6  7  The synonym self teaching computers was also used in this time period  8  9   The earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side  but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes  10  In 1949  Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior  in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells  11  Hebb s model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes  or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data  10  Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well  including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch  who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes  10   By the early 1960s  an experimental  learning machine  with punched tape memory  called Cybertron  had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals  electrocardiograms  and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning  It was repetitively  trained  by a human operator teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a  goof  button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions  12  A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson s book on Learning Machines  dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification  13  Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s  as described by Duda and Hart in 1973  14  In 1981  a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognise 40 characters  26 letters  10 digits  and 4 special symbols  from a computer terminal  15   Tom M  Mitchell provided a widely quoted  more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field   A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T  as measured by P  improves with experience E   16  This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms  This follows Alan Turing s proposal in his paper  Computing Machinery and Intelligence   in which the question  Can machines think   is replaced with the question  Can machines do what we  as thinking entities  can do    17   Modern day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithms types  Supervised Learning Algorithms  Unsupervised Learning Algorithms  and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms  18   Current Supervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of classification and regression  Current Unsupervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of clustering  dimensionality reduction  and association rule  Current Reinforcement Learning Algorithms focus on decisions that must be made with respect to some previous  unknown time and are broken down to either be studies of model based methods  and model free methods  In 2014 Ian Goodfellow and others introduced generative adversarial networks  GANs  with realistic data synthesis  19  By 2016 AlphaGo obtained victory against top human players using reinforcement learning techniques  20  Shortly after  transformer architectures obtained natural language processing  powering the now popular large language models advancing generative AI and multimodal applications  21   Relationships to other fields Artificial intelligence  Deep learning is a subset of machine learning  which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence  22  As a scientific endeavour  machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence  AI   In the early days of AI as an academic discipline  some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data  They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods  as well as what were then termed  neural networks   these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of statistics  23  Probabilistic reasoning was also employed  especially in automated medical diagnosis  24   488   However  an increasing emphasis on the logical  knowledge based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning  Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation  24   488  By 1980  expert systems had come to dominate AI  and statistics was out of favour  25  Work on symbolic knowledge based learning did continue within AI  leading to inductive logic programming ILP   but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper  in pattern recognition and information retrieval  24   708 710  755  Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time  This line  too  was continued outside the AI CS field  as  connectionism   by researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield  David Rumelhart  and Geoffrey Hinton  Their main success came in the mid 1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation  24   25   Machine learning  ML   reorganised and recognised as its own field  started to flourish in the 1990s  The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature  It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI  and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics  fuzzy logic  and probability theory  25   Data compression This section is an excerpt from Data compression   Machine learning  edit  There is a close connection between machine learning and compression  A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression  by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution   Conversely  an optimal compressor can be used for prediction  by finding the symbol that compresses best  given the previous history   This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for  general intelligence   26  27  28   An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors  and compression based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces  For each compressor C    we define an associated vector space    such that C    maps an input string x  corresponding to the vector norm    x    An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space  instead  feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods  LZW  LZ77  and PPM  29   According to AIXI theory  a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize  the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x  For example  in that model  a zip file s compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software  since you can not unzip it without both  but there may be an even smaller combined form   Examples of AI powered audio video compression software include NVIDIA Maxine  AIVC  30  Examples of software that can perform AI powered image compression include OpenCV  TensorFlow  MATLAB s Image Processing Toolbox  IPT  and High Fidelity Generative Image Compression  31   In unsupervised machine learning  k means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters  This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression  32   Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files  enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission  K means clustering  an unsupervised machine learning algorithm  is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters  k  each represented by the centroid of its points  This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points  Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing  k means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids  thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significa'"
